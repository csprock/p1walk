This repository contains supplementary material for the paper ``Goodness-of-fit for log-linear network models: Dynamic Markov bases using hypergraphs'' by Elizabeth Gross, Sonja Petrovic, and Despina Stasi (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10463-016-0560-2).
In particular, it contains the R code necessary to carry out the p-value computations discussed in the paper. 

The file p1walk.R contains all functions needed to run Algorithms 1-5, including additional auxiliary functions for storing the data from a random walk. All functions are described within the file.

The file OHT.R  contains the graph from Figure 5 and code to obtain simulation results from Section 4.1.
